# Resume Building

Most resumes perform better with tangible data. If you're able to describe in calcuable amounts how
you benefitted your previous companies. It's a good idea to have a basic resume with all your work
experience, skills, and any relevant volunteer or other information.

# Security Consultants

Almost every business today will at some point run a security check. This could range from sending 
a fake phishing email to actually having a security consultant break in and test all security
features of the company.
