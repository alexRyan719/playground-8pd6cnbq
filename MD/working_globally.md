# Working Globally

To function in an ever shrinking world, a tech professional needs to be able to 
communicate with people from other cultures, backgrounds, and especially langauges.
Many times, you will work with another language in some way or another. Whether it's
coding, working with regulations, or directly working with people or teams that don't
speak your language. 

# Google Translate

Google Translate allows for informal communication between different languages. It 
is free, but there are some considerations you will need to know to use it effectively.
For some languages, like Arabic, the direction of how it is read is different. This 
means that however it is broken up might sound backwards, or sections might not 
fit together logically.
