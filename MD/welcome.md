# Welcome!

Welcome to Mr. Smuff's Technical Academy! I am Mr. Smuff, and I implore you to take a look around! 

This acadamey is just starting out, so it might not seem like much at the moment. Remember to check
back later to see what is being added! 

We are going to start out with basics of how to apply for tech jobs and what one should know before
applying to tech jobs. This includes any area of Computer Science or technical understanding that 
could be relevant to the job being applied to. 

# Who is Mr. Smuff?

Mr. Smuff is a kind forest gnome that enjoys helping others. He has taken it upon himself to start an
academy where curious minds could dabble in the Science and Sorcery that is Computer Science.
